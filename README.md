This is a SourceMod plugin designed for Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, made in the spirit of an old server named CelMod.

I wrote this in 2014, and it was one of my first programming projects.

It is a complete mess, and I spent a long time reiterating on it and trying to make it better, but this is the most complete version.
